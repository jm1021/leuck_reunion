### Warm-Up continued, Abrahamic Covenant renewed through Isaac
What do we think of the deceit?  What is difference between birth right and blessing?
1. Rebekah's revelation

```text
Genesis 25
23 And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
```

2. Lord tells Issac he will bless nations per Abrahamic Coventant [Genesis 26:1-5](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/26.1-5?lang=eng#p1)
3. Rebekah and Jacob deceive Isaac [Genesis 26:6-24](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/27.6-24?lang=eng#p5)
4. Blessing of Jacob as he impersonates Esau

```text
27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed:

28 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

29 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.
```

5. Blessing of Esau as he returns after his blessing has been given

```text
39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;

40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
```

6. Rebekah tells Jacob to flee to her brother Laban, as Esau says he will slay Jacob.


### Pottage
We can choose between immediate gratification and things of greater value. Jacob acquires birth right from Esau.

```text
Genisis 25

29 ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:

30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?

33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
```
