### Plagues of Today

Missionaries proclaim, [There is Peace](https://youtu.be/x0kki9l02KM)

Will we or the powers that rule be able to turn away from things that seem "comfortable" or "entitled". Perhaps fossile fuel cars.

### The Plagues of Egypt
This story parallels many of the troubling events in our world today.  Often logic, power, and glories of God do not stop man from carrying on according to what they perceive as "comfortable" or "entitled".  Pharoah was obviously enamored with having the children of Israel work for them.  Do we have things of comfort that make us similar to Pharoah?

1. Turning water to blood: [Ex. 7:14–24](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/7.14-24?lang=eng#p13), Algae from excess water usage or drought
2. Frogs: [Ex. 8:2-4](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/8.2-4?lang=eng#p1), Frogs leaving the river
3. Lice: [Ex. 8:16–19](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/8.16-19?lang=eng#p15), Dead frogs decomposing
4. Flies: [Ex. 8:24](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/8.24?lang=eng#p23), Flies breeding from decomposition
5. Pestilence of livestock: [Ex. 9:1–7](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/9.3-7?lang=eng#p2), Disease spreading
6. Boils: [Ex. 9:8–12](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/9.8-12?lang=eng#p7), Greek Santorini volcano and acid rain
7. Thunderstorm of hail and fire: Ex. 9:13–35
8. Locusts: Ex. 10:1–20
9. Darkness for three days: Ex. 10:21–29
10. Death of firstborn son: Ex. 11:1–12:36, [The Passover and the Exodus](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/exodus-11-19-the-passover-and-the-exodus?lang=eng)
    * Abraham to sacrifice Isaac provided a similitude of God’s sacrifice of His Only Begotten Son (see Jacob 4:5). 
    * Joseph, who was sold into Egypt, provided a type or symbol of Christ and His ministry (see Reading 8-19). 
    * The ancient Passovers were always defined by a full moon.
    * Ex 12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male bof the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: Ex 12:6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
    * “It was, of course, while Jesus and the Twelve were keeping the Feast of the Passover that our Lord instituted the ordinance of the sacrament ([Holy Week](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/easter/easter-week).  perhaps 1 Apr 33, Wednesday or 2 Apr 33, Thursday).  We now observe the law of the sacrament instead of the Passover because the Passover was consummated in full by the death of Jesus Christ.


### Parallels of Moses in today's society
Is God and the Prophets telling us to change? We just listened to our prophet.  We are being directed in a manner similar to the children of Israel, we are being directed to follow the Lord.

* Prophet declares, [The Power of Spiritual Momentum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng)
    * Get on the covenant path and stay there, "Ordinances and covenants give us access to godly power."
    * Discover the joy of daily repentance, "Walking the covenant path, coupled with daily repentance, fuels positive spiritual momentum", "... the covenant path does not mean that life will be easy"
    * Learn about God and how He works, "... let God prevail in your life", "Moses provided an example of how to discern between God and Satan."
    * Seek and expect miracles, "He parted the Red Sea for Moses", "...realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life."
    * End conflict in your personal life, today is the day to "seek and end to personal conflict that has weighed you down"
