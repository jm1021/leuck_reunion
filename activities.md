### Thursday Boating in Shifts (Jared)
> Boating at the Lake.  In the Eugene days the family had several boating trips at the surrounding lakes.  UJ (Frank's brother) was the center of many of these trips.  Picking up for UJ, Jared is coordinating a boating adventure ...

This is a water sport boat.  It has a high performance boat (v8 power) with wakeboard tower that can pull a large wakeboarder, skier, tuber, and is even equipped for wake-surfing.  Jared has a ski/wakeboard rented for all day Thursday 6/29.  

OG families are asked to contribute $135.  This cost can be distributed to those who plan to participate.  We will need to obtain a head count for each of the four sessions.  We want to limit trip to 8 people at a time.
